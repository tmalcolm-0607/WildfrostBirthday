## Key Findings & Recommendations

- **Most planned items and effects are implemented and use base game effects where possible.**
- **Custom effects are only implemented where unique logic is required.**
- **Missing items:** Stock of Foam Bullets, Detonation Strike, Freezing Treat (not implemented yet).
- **Missing effect:** "Add Attack & Health To Summon" is not implemented, but can be recreated using base game attack/health buffs.
- **No need to re-register or duplicate base game effects.**
- **Continue using helpers (SStack, TStack, etc.) to assign effects by name.**
- **For new items/effects, first check if the base game already provides the needed effect.**

This audit can be used as a checklist for future development and to ensure all planned features are either implemented, assigned, or have a clear path using existing effects.

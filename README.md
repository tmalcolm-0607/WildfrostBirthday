💖 MadHouse Family Tribe – A Wildfrost Mod
This mod was created as a labor of love for our incredible mother — the heart, light, and glue of our family. In this custom Wildfrost experience, we’ve brought our whole family into the game as a new tribe: The MadFamily.

Every leader and companion reflects someone we love dearly — from Mom’s unwavering support, to Dad’s steady strength, to the boundless creativity and energy of our kids, and even our pugs, Lulu and Poppy, who never leave our side. Each ability, each stat, and each charm was designed with care, memories, and laughter in mind.

This mod is more than new content — it's a thank you. A celebration of the chaos, the warmth, and the magic that only our family brings. We hope it makes you smile as much as you’ve made us smile all our lives.

From your loving son,
Thank you, Mom.
You’re our leader in every adventure — in Wildfrost and in life.

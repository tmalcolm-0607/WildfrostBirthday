# Cards

This folder will contain modular card registration logic for the Wildfrost MadFamily Tribe mod. Each card should be defined in its own file/class with a static Register(WildFamilyMod mod) method, following the same pattern as status effects and charms.

- Place one card per file for maintainability.
- Update the main mod file to call each card's Register method.
- See docs/Tutorial2_CardsAndStatusEffects.md for best practices.
